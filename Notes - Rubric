I created the screenshots based on the rubrics and I put them in its correspondent screenshot subfolder:

For the Set Up Application Insight - The screenshots have the prefix api_
For the Analyzing Performance Metrics the prefix apm_
For the VM Autoscaling the prefix vma
For the Automate Resolution of Performance Issues the prefix apr_

For the output of the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler I executed the command:

kubectl get pods 

so, I could compare the results from before the horizontal autoscaler was triggered with the process load. I put that screenshot. I could user the graphic 
in Azure option but I like the command client ... :)

Thanks ...
